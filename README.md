# ParraPark
This GitHub repository contains the basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript code for the Parramatta Park Dairy Cottage mobile app that I developed as part of a four-person team while undertaking a professional experience unit during my studies at Western Sydney University (WSU). This portion of the project is as per the final version completed in October 2017 and has not been altered since then. When this project was developed my team used PhoneGap to package the application into a mobile friendly format; it does NOT contain any PhoneGap-related software or code but should be relatively easy to package into an APK on someone else's end.

The main purpose of this repository is to showcase some of the work that I have done during my studies at university. As such, it will be very unlikely that I will make any big changes to this application in the future.

This application contains a bit of history content about Parramatta Park, located in the western suburbs of Sydney, Australia (and a UNESCO World Heritage-listed site), but the main highlight of this application is its' 360 degree photo content, which was designed to give viewers of this application a look inside the historic Dairy and Rangers' Cottages (both of which are only able to have a certain number of guided tours in a year due to the degradation of their structural integrity over time - both buildings were constructed during the colonial period of Australian history). The 360 degree photos were taken on a project team member's phone, then embedded into HTML using the PanoLens.js panorama viewer software.

The app is best viewed in Chrome's developer mode (keyboard shortcut Ctrl-Shift-I for the uninitiated); the CSS in this project is best optimised for mobile devices, hence why it appears stretched on a desktop screen.

I've licenced the code of this project (barring the PanoLens libraries, which IIRC might be under a MIT Licence) under a GPL licence for now but do keep in mind that some visual components of this app were provided by the project's client and as such should not be reused in other projects.

Have fun!
