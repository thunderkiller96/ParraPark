    <div class="title">SUNKEN DAIRY</div>
    <div class="text">In 1993, a small team led by Wendy Thorpe took up the floor of the Rangers Cottage. The few artefacts they recovered indicated it was filled with industrial slag between 1890 and WWI. Beer bottles from the 1880s cellar and the steps and remains of the sandstone shelves were discovered. Stone flagging found along the northern wall was interpreted as the original floor of the dairy, and in the centre of the room was a well. It is currently unknown when the well was constructed. It may have been built at the same time as Salterâ€™s 1790 cottage or once the Dairy was no longer functioning after 1858.

    <div class="text">By the 1870s, the colony was prosperous and buildings were constructed by tradespeople rather than artisan convicts. The Rangers Cottage is typical of late Victorian houses with its double brick walls, solid large doors, high ceilings and hung windows. This is in contrast to the dairy cottage next door.
