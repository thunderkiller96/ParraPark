    <p>The Dairy Precinct was home to the Park Rangers from the 1850s until 1970s. The Ranger’s children and their friends played in the Dairy Cottage, Rangers Cottage and throughout the Park.<br/><br/>

        At this location, a former convict named George Salter received a 30 acre grant in 1796. Salter established a flourishing farm with 10 acres of land cultivated in wheat and another 20 acres cultivated in maize. When Salter left for Hobart in 1813, Governor Lachlan Macquarie purchased his farm and re-established it as a dairy. The milk, cheese and butter made here was supplied to Government House and local institutions.<br/><br/>

        This building, known as the Dairy Cottage or ‘Salter’s Cottage’, was constructed between 1796 and 1805 as a two-roomed cottage by ex-convict George Salter. It is one of the earliest intact cottages still standing in Australia today.<br/><br/>
