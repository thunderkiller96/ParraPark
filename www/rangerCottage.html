    <!-- <h3>RANGERS COTTAGE:</h3> -->
    <p>In 1789, George Salter was transported to Parramatta for his role in a smuggling ring. After he had served a seven-year sentence he was granted 30 acres of land in 1796. This land grant included the Dairy Precinct and it became a successful farm. In 1813, Salter sold his land to Governor Macquarie and moved to Hobart.<br/><br/> 

    By 1816, the governor had converted Salter’s farm into a dairy. The sunken dairy was built to the south of the Dairy Cottage in 1823. The sunken dairy was a rectangular cottage that measured 5.8m by 4.3m. Inside was a single room that was excavated to a depth of 1.5m below ground surface. A staircase along one wall led to the floor of the sunken dairy and the other walls were lined with stone work benches. It was used to store milk, cheese and butter.<br/><br/>

    After the Vice-Regal Domain was opened to the public as Parramatta Park in 1858, the Dairy Precinct became the home of the Park Rangers.<br/><br/> 

    By the 1880s, the sunken dairy had been demolished and a Rangers Cottage was built in its location. The sunken dairy was soon forgotten about, buried deep beneath the cottage until the 1980’s.<br/><br/>

    In 1987, archaeologist Annie Bickford carried out an unsuccessful excavation in the Dairy Cottage where the sunken dairy was thought to be located. After an interview with Ms Win Whitehead, the daughter of a former park ranger, it was suggested that the sunken dairy was more likely to be under the Rangers Cottage.<br/><br/>
